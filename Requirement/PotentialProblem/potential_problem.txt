Web crawling side: 
1. The WEB Sudok web page is not working in the way as expected.  For instance:
	- When a user input something in any slots, the webpage is NOT changing
	  anything. UNLESS the user press then ENTER. Hence the ENTER is
	  actually a hot-key for "How am I doing?" button. 
	- The puzzle is just a 9 x 9 <tbody>. However, for each <tr> tags,
	  there is no such field to represent the value. Therefore, the
	  approach is either: press ENTER every time when the board is updated,
	  or only press ENTER once when there is no empty slot. 

More importantly for a cheat. Yes, we are literally making a cheat... This
principle is developmented by me. It's that be a pathetic hider. You can't let
other people or the softeware developer  know you are cheating, hence, the
cheat should perform more like a human. An example is I add mistakes for my
AutoType. So for this one: Just solve it and change the entire board probably
not a good idea, rather show the progress of each number we filled in. 

Discuss with me if you have any thought about it.

Umar thoughts:

I don't understand the tbody problem you are having with selenium. How are the
values stored within the the specific feild? 

should we have some sort of ENTER key functionality. My understanding was that
the sudoku problem solver will just solve the puzzle and that's it.
