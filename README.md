# Sudoku Solver

This program will auto-solve a Sudoku puzzle from [WEB SUDOKU](https://www.websudoku.com/).  

2019 Summer Project. This project will be 
following the software development process that I learned from my 
"Intermedia to Software Engineer" class which I took in the winter. 
Briefly speaking, follow the [Agile design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development).
