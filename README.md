# Sudoku Solver

This program will auto-solve a Sudoku puzzle from [WEB SUDOKU](https://www.websudoku.com/).  

2019 Summer Project. I am the only developer. This project will be 
following the software development process that I learned from my 
"Intermedia to Software Engineer" class which I took in the winter. 
Briefly speaking: write requirement doc., design doc., and coding and 
testing.
